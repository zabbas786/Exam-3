% these to the entire rows and columns to which they are to be applied.  In
% other words, literally do what is in 11.2.4, ignoring where the zeroes
% are when you apply the Givens' rotation.
%
% Next, think carefully about where the nonzeroes are (or are introduced)
% and only update those elements in the rows and/or columns.
%
% Finally, and this is optional, write the routine so you don't corrupt any
% entries below the diagonal and above the first superdiagonal.  Don't
% waste too much time on this.
% Below, we just execute a bunch of these steps, to see if the elements on
% the superdiagonal converge the way they should.
